Some checks were not successful. Go to GitHub Actions and pull the logs for the CI/CD workflows to identify the errors and determine why the build fails. Correct the errors and push your changes. Repeat this process until all checks pass for the code you pushed. Write to memory what you did to resolve the build failures so that CI/CD checks can be quickly addressed in future builds.
