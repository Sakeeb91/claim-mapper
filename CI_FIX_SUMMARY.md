# CI/CD Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ ML Service: Removed async from test fixtures
2. ✅ Frontend: Added Suspense boundaries for useSearchParams
3. ✅ Tests: Fixed circular dependencies in api.test.ts
4. ✅ Tests: Fixed KnowledgeGraph large dataset test
5. ✅ Lint: Cleaned up unused imports

## Remaining (non-critical):
- 200+ ESLint warnings (mostly unused vars)
- React act() warnings in some tests
- These don't block CI/CD pipeline
